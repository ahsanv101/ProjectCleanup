# ProjectCleanup

Karachi, Pakistanâ€™s largest city, generates more than 13,500 tons of municipal waste
daily. All major cities face enormous challenges on how to manage urban waste [1].
So, in an attempt to move towards solving a big part of the huge problem that the
garbage crisis encompasses, we have developed a system that will aid the garbage
collection process in Karachi.

The system does so by allowing users to capture/upload images of garbage dumps in
their locality. It then coarsely segments the garbage, quantifies it, and map out an
efficient route on the admin panel. This route mapping aids the garbage collection
process as it provides the route to the garbage pickup trucks. It can be used as an
efficient tool of resource management and allocation.

The system is divided into three major components; the user application, the cloud
model and the web application which is an interface for the administrator. The
cloud model further consist of two major processes: The identification of the garbage
(building upon the work of SpotGarbage) and the Quantification of the Garbage.Our
system is completely cloud-based and uses Google Cloud Services and Storage.
